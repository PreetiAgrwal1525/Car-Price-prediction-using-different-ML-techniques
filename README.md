# Car-Price-prediction-using-different-ML-techniques
The main objective of this project is to utilize ML techniques, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor models, to make predictions about the prices of cars. These models are trained using a dataset that includes characteristics of cars, such as their make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and other information.
